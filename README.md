# FlashCards Project
This application allows users to create decks of flash cards to assist with studying.  Users can create new decks, add cards to decks and review the decks as quizzes.
The app also has built in notifications to encourage the user to study every morning.  Notifications are reset if the user chooses to take a quiz.

# Platform
This app was developed and tested using expo running on iPhone X

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `expo start`
* A window will open with links that can be used to view the app in a browser or a simulator if available.
